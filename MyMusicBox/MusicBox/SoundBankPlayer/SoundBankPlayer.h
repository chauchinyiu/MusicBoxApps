 * For continuous tone instruments (such as an organ sound) set this to YES.
 *
 * Make sure you provide raw sound fonts that wrap nicely, i.e. try to catch a
 * whole number of waves in the sample and clip it at the zero crossings. Even
 * then it's hard to get perfect, so it's better to use really long samples.
 * If you set loopNotes to YES, then you will need to call noteOff: to quiet a
 * playing note.
 *
 * For piano notes and other sounds that naturally decay to silence, set this
 * property to NO. You don't need to call noteOff:, the note will automatically
 * terminate itself when it has played to the end of the sample.
